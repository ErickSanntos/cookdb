Recipe List:

The right column (col-sm-6) displays a list of recipes.
It iterates through the "messages" array and displays each recipe's name, ingredients/instructions, and the number of likes (thumbUp).
There are icons for thumbs-up and thumbs-down, but they are not associated with functionality in this HTML template.
Add a Recipe:

If the user has a local email associated with their account, they can add a new recipe.
A form allows users to input a recipe name and ingredients/instructions, and they can submit it.
